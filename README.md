### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from DePaul University with a degree in Computer Science.

I started coding in high school because my friend, Isaac Moldofsky told me about a class where you can make video games.
I have always loved playing games, and that was what initially drew me to wanting to learn how to code.

Throughout my higher education, I lost touch with that inital draw a bit and felt lost in all of the potential paths that being able to code affords.
In my final year of university, I discovered web development with React, which I found fun.
I also played a game called The Witness, which reminded me of why I wanted to start coding in the first place.

Right now, I'm looking for positions that can provide experience specifically in either of those diciplines.

You can visit the website I made (before I learned any web frameworks) here to download my resume and find links to my online profiles, visit my LinkedIn profile, or send me an email!
