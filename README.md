### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from [DePaul University](https://www.DePaul.edu) with a degree in Computer Science.

I started coding in high school because my friend, [Isaac Moldofsky](https://github.com/ismcodes) told me about a class where you can make video games.
I have always loved playing games, and that was what initially drew me to wanting to learn how to code.

Throughout my higher education, I lost touch with that inital draw a bit and felt lost in all of the potential paths that being able to code affords.
In my final year of university, I discovered web development with [React](https://reactjs.org/), which I found fun.
I also played a game called [*The Witness*](http://the-witness.net/), which reminded me of why I wanted to start coding in the first place.

Right now, I'm looking for positions that can provide experience ideally in either, or both, of those diciplines.

You can visit [the website I made](https://RossNelson.me) (before I learned any web frameworks) to download my resume and find links to my online profiles, visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.LinkedIn.com/in/RossNel), or send me an [email](mailto:RossN430@gmail.com)(RossN430@gmail.com)!
