### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate from [DePaul University](https://www.DePaul.edu) with a degree in Computer Science.

I started coding in high school because my friend, [Isaac Moldofsky](https://github.com/ismcodes) told me about a class where you can make video games.
I have always loved playing games, and that was what initially drew me to wanting to learn how to code.

Now I'm working at Oracle doing things like Site Reliability, DevOps, Release Management, and more.

You can visit [my website](https://RossNelson.me) to download my resume and find links to my online profiles, visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.LinkedIn.com/in/RossNel), or send me an [email](mailto:RossN430@gmail.com)(RossN430@gmail.com)!
